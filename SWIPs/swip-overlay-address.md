## Specification

### Swarm Overlay Address

Swarm addresses all content\[1\] and all nodes using the `Base Hash`
directly, or algorithms employing multiple `Base Hash` operations.

A node address is called its `Swarm Overlay Address`. It is derived from
the `ECDSA Public Key` of the Ethereum account used to operate the node.

To obtain the `Swarm Overlay Address`, calculate the `Base Hash` of the
*uncompressed* form of the `ECDSA Public Key`, *including* its \(04\)
(uncompressed) prefix. 

Formally we define the `Swarm Overlay Address` thus:

    OVERLAYADDRESS = 32*(%x00-ff)

#### Swarm Address Pair

To enable peers to locate the a node on the network, the aforementioned
`Swarm Overlay Address` is paired with a `Swarm Underlay Address`.

The `Swarm Underlay Address` is a string representation of the nodeâ€™s
network location on the underlying transport layer, and *MUST* contain
sufficient data to enable peers to initiate new connections to the node.

    UNDERLAYADDRESS = VCHAR
    ADDRESSPAIR=2#2list(OVERLAYADDRESS UNDERLAYADDRESS)
