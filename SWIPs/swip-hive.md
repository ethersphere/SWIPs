## Specification

The connectivity driver of Swarm is named the `Hive`. The component
decides which peers to make connections to by consulting the `Kademlia`
for known but unconnected peers, and by invoking the `Discovery
Protocol` to alert peers about changes in its peer database.

### Saturation and Depth

In Swarm, a fully connected state is referred to as *Saturation*.

A *Proximity Bin* is saturated when it has at least \(2\) connected
peers.

A *node* is saturated if:

  - it is connected to all existing peers in its neighborhood

  - all Proximity Bins farther away than Depth are saturated

In the context of the Hive, the `Depth` at any moment before or during a
saturated condition is called `Saturation Depth`. This interpretation of
`Depth` differs slightly from the `Neighborhood Depth` used for routing
decisions. Specifically, it is the `Proximity Order` farthest from the
`Neighborhood Depth` that is *not* saturated. If no such bin exists,
`Saturation Depth` is effectively the same as the `Neighborhood Depth`.

### Prioritizing connections

A non-saturated node should seek connections with peers in the following
order of priority:

1.  the closest unconnected neighbors

2.  the farthest bin that has the least connected peers

### Retrying connections

If a peer connection fails or is disconnected, the node MUST reconnect.

If the initial reconnection attempt fails, the node SHOULD exponentially
increase the time it waits before retrying. The nodeâ€™s reconnection
attempts SHOULD stay within the minimum bounds of the algorithm:

1.  If more than 42 retries have been attempted, discard the peer and do
    not continue

2.  Caluculate the time delta that since last retry

3.  Calculate the *number of warranted retries* by subtracting \(2\)
    from the \(log_2\) of the time delta

4.  Retry if the *number of warranted retries* is higher than the number
    of retries that has been made
