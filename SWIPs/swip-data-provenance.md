## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SWIP.-->

This SWIP proposes Swarm as a decentralized storage layer for provenance metadata and data. Provenance, the documented history of a dataset's origin and transformations, is increasingly important for regulatory compliance, ethical AI, and data accountability. A toolkit will provide utilities to:
- Upload/Download: Store and retrieve provenance files (in any format) with Swarm reference hashes.
- Metadata Management: Track storage validity (TTL) and extend it via stamp top-ups.
- Data Integrity: Verify content through SHA-256 hashes.

The framework does not enforce specific provenance standards but ensures compatibility by decoupling metadata (structured JSON) from the actual provenance data (stored as arbitrary files). Developers and enterprises retain full control over their data format and privacy measures.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->

Provenance systems require immutable, scalable storage to track data lineage effectively. This SWIP leverages Swarm’s decentralized network to:
- Store Provenance Data: Users upload files in any format (e.g., W3C PROV-JSONLD, DaTA spec, or custom schemas).
- Manage Metadata: A JSON wrapper includes:
  - `provenance_metadata_id` (UUID for unique identification)
  - `data_swarm_reference` (Swarm hash pointing to the provenance file)
  - `stamp_id` (for TTL tracking and renewal)
  - `content_hash` (SHA-256 for integrity checks)
  - `provenance_standard` (optional field for self-declared standards)
- Ensure Flexibility: No Swarm-level validation of provenance formats—compatibility is achieved by design.

A prototype toolkit (developed under the DataFund Fellowship) will provide CLI and API access to Swarm, enabling integration into existing workflows. Privacy and encryption remain optional, allowing users to comply with regulations like GDPR independently.



## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for SWIPs that want to change the Swarm protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the SWIP solves. SWIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
Data provenance is critical for ethical AI development, regulatory compliance, and ensuring trust in data-driven systems. Existing provenance solutions often face challenges in terms of vendor lock-in, scalability, and privacy. Centralized systems create dependencies and potential single points of failure. Public blockchains, while immutable, can be costly for large-scale data storage and may not adequately address privacy concerns.

Swarm offers a compelling alternative by acting as a trustless, decentralized storage network:

-   **Trusted 3rd Party**: Swarm's decentralized architecture serves as a neutral platform for recording provenance, eliminating single points of control.
-   **Cost Considerations**: While centralized cloud storage may offer lower costs for simple storage, Swarm provides a more cost-competitive option compared to blockchain-based solutions.
-   **Interoperability**: The toolkit is designed to accommodate various provenance standards (e.g., DaTA, W3C PROV) without enforcing a specific format, allowing users to adopt the standard that best suits their needs.

This proposal aims to align with the Data Spaces Support Centre blueprint for a Technical Building Block covering Provenance & Traceability. By enabling easy uploading, downloading, and management of provenance files, the toolkit empowers users to meet emerging regulatory requirements, such as those outlined in the EU AI Act, and to establish trust and accountability in data-driven systems.


## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for the current Swarm platform and future client implementations.-->


### 1. Provenance Record Structure
The provenance file will be stored in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
  "provenance_metadata_id": "UUID string",
  "content_hash": "sha256:9f86d...a9e",
  "provenance_standard": "DaTA v1.0.0",
  "data_swarm_reference": "",
  "stamp_id": "0xfe2f...c3a1"
}
```

*This structure allows a unique identification of the metadata itself (UUID), a reference to the actual provenance data via a Swarm hash, a declaration of the provenance standard used, and the stamp associated with the storage.*

### 2. Toolkit Features
The toolkit provides functionalities to interact with the Swarm network:

- **Provenance Metadata Upload**: Uploads the JSON metadata file to Swarm.
- **Provenance Data Upload**: Uploads the actual provenance data file to Swarm.
- **Provenance Metadata Access**: Retrieves the JSON metadata file using its Swarm reference hash.
- **Provenance Data Access**: Retrieves the actual provenance data file using its Swarm reference hash.
- **Check TTL**: Queries the stamp associated with the storage to determine the remaining storage duration for both the metadata and the data.
- **Stamp Top-Up**: Extends the storage period for the associated stamp (both the metadata and the data are extended).
- **Data Existence Check**: Verifies whether the data (provenance metadata and/or actual provenance data) exists on the Swarm network.

These features can utilize a Swarm gateway or a local Bee node, as per the user’s choice.

### 3. Privacy Controls

*Privacy controls are optional at later stages and are left to the discretion of the user. The user can choose to encrypt the data before uploading it.*


## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
Swarm’s decentralized nature makes it ideal for acting as a trusted third party in provenance systems. Unlike public blockchains, it supports larger data sizes without compromising privacy when encryption is used. While standards like W3C PROV are comprehensive, they may be too complex for some use cases; simpler alternatives like the Data & Trust Alliance spec are more practical for initial implementations. This approach allows flexibility while ensuring compatibility with existing standards.

- Adopting Existing Standards: By relying on the simpler DaTA spec for most use cases (with the option for W3C PROV), the solution avoids over-complication while maintaining interoperability.
- Swarm’s Suitability: Its decentralized, immutable nature makes it an ideal candidate for storing provenance data, which benefits from being tamper-resistant and verifiable.
- AI Integration: Embedding AI within the upload flow can not only prevent privacy breaches but also assist in interpreting provenance data—a value-add that enhances user trust and usability.

A comparative advantage over alternatives (e.g., centralized storage solutions or blockchain-based systems) is seen in Swarm’s cost-effectiveness and scalability, without compromising security or data integrity.

## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All SWIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The SWIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. SWIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->
This proposal does not introduce changes to Swarm’s core functionality or protocols. It leverages existing capabilities such as immutable storage and reference hashes, ensuring full compatibility with current implementations.
It operates on top of the existing Swarm infrastructure and adheres to established file storage and retrieval methods. All existing Swarm tools (like the Bee CLI and Dashboard) remain fully compatible with this additional use case.


## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SWIPs that are affecting changes to data and message formats. Other SWIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any SWIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the SWIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
A prototype toolkit will be developed as part of the fellowship deliverables. This toolkit will include features for uploading, retrieving, validating, and extending storage of provenance data on Swarm.
