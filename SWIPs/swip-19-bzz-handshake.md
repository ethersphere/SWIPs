## Specification

### bzz protocol

#### handshake

The bzz handshake is the first message to be exchanged between peers
after the p2p transport protocol has been successfully negotiated. After
the handshake each peer should remember the following data about the
other:

  - `Swarm Overlay Address` of the peer [\[address\]](#address)

  - What `Capabilities` the peer has advertised
    [\[capabilities\]](#capabilities)

##### message

The handshake message consists of four data fields:

``` 

Version     = UINT64
Network ID  = UINT64
Address data    = ADDRESSPAIR
Capabilities    = CAPABILITIES
```

##### procedure

Upon connection, the *peer who initiated the connection* sends a
handshake message to the other. If a more than one handshake is received
from the same peer, the connection *MUST* be dropped.

The peers *MUST* have the same `Version` and `Network ID`. If one or
both of the fields donâ€™t match, the connection *MUST* be dropped.
