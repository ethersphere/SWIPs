## Abstract

This SWIP is a part of a general specification of a Swarm node. The SWIP system is used for convenience only.

## Motivation

Enable other implementations of the swarm node.

## Specification

### BZZ protocol

#### Handshake

The bzz handshake is the first message to be exchanged between peers
after the p2p transport protocol has been successfully negotiated. After
the handshake a node should remember the following data about its peer:

  - `Swarm Overlay Address` of the peer
    [overlay-address](https://github.com/nolash/SWIPs/blob/swarm-overlay-address/SWIPs/swip-overlay-address.md)

  - What `Capabilities` the peer has advertised
    [capabilities](https://github.com/nolash/SWIPs/blob/spec-capabilities/SWIPs/swip-18-capabilities.md)

##### Message

The handshake message consists of four data fields:

| id | def |
| :--- | :---- |
| Version | UINT64 |
| Network | UINT64 |
| Address | ADDRESSPAIR |
| Capabilities | CAPABILITIES |

##### Procedure

Upon connection, the *peer who initiated the connection* sends a
handshake message to the other. If more than one handshake is received
from the same peer, the connection *MUST* be dropped.

The peers *MUST* have the same `Version` and `Network ID`. If one or
both of the fields donâ€™t match, the connection *MUST* be dropped.
